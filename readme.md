# Aye-Aye Software Foundation

## **Introduction**
The **Aye-Aye Software Foundation** is a community-driven initiative dedicated to building practical, adaptable, and open-source solutions for the modern digital economy. Inspired by the aye-aye, a misunderstood and resilient creature, our mission is to create tools that are as unique and durable as our namesake.

## **Core Principles**
1. **MIT License**:  
   All our projects are MIT licensed. We are industry builders, committed to fostering innovation and collaboration through accessible and open software.

2. **Technological Priorities**:
   - **Easily Deployed**: Tools should be ready to use with minimal setup.
   - **Widely Available**: We use technologies and languages that are accessible across platforms.
   - **FAST!**: Performance is critical for both end-users and developers.
   - **Hackable and Modifiable**: Codebases are designed for easy customization and forking.

3. **Design Philosophy**:
   - Inspired by the **Unix Philosophy**, our software is modular, lightweight, and focused:
     - Each app solves one killer problem.
     - Apps integrate seamlessly but can stand alone.
   - No monolithic platforms. Instead, we create a suite of small, purpose-driven apps.

4. **Forking Encouraged**:
   - We welcome forks and contributions. Clear and readable code ensures anyone can innovate and adapt our tools.
